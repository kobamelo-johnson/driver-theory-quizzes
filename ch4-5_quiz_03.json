    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question_text": "You want to join the Highway from the accelerating lane. What is the correct procedure if you cannot join immediately due to high traffic density?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Drive onto the hard shoulder and merge at the first opportunity.",
        "b": "Maintain high speed and force your vehicle into the driving lane.",
        "c": "Stop toward the end of the accelerating lane."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "According to the manual, if high traffic prevents you from joining the Highway, you must continue to the end of the accelerating lane and stop there if necessary. Traffic on the Highway has priority.",

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question_text": "You are driving at night with dipped headlights on a good country road. Within what distance must you be able to stop at the latest?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Within the range of the vision illuminated by the dipped headlights.",
        "b": "Within 100 metres regardless of the visibility range.",
        "c": "Within twice the range of your headlights to allow for reaction time."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A fundamental rule of speed at night is that you must be able to stop within the range of vision provided by your dipped headlights to ensure you can react to hazards you illuminate.",

      "image_url": null
    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question_text": "By which rule of thumb can you determine the reaction distance in metres for a motor vehicle?",
      "options": {
        "a": "(Speed in km/h ÷ 10) x 3",
        "b": "(Speed in km/h ÷ 10) x (Speed in km/h ÷ 10)",
        "c": "(Speed in km/h ÷ 10) x 5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The manual provides a specific rule of thumb for reaction distance: take your speed, divide by 10, and multiply by 3. This accounts for the distance traveled during your reaction time.",

      "options": {
        "a": "Your vehicle will be pushed sharply to the left onto the hard shoulder.",
        "b": "The truck will create a slipstream that pushes your vehicle toward the right.",
        "c": "Your vehicle is pulling to the left when you enter the slipstream of the truck."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "When overtaking a high-sided vehicle in crosswinds, you must reckon with the slipstream effect. As you move alongside, the wind is blocked, creating a vacuum effect that pulls your car toward the truck.",

        "c": "You sound your horn and open your door slightly to warn him."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Defensive driving requires that you act to prevent danger even if others are ignoring the rules. You should allow the motorcyclist to pass rather than causing a conflict or hazard.",

        "a": "On steep uphill gradients.",
        "b": "Where there are grooves in the roadway.",
        "c": "At well-drained junctions with farm tracks."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Aquaplaning occurs when water cannot escape from under the tyres. It happens most often where water collects, such as in roadway grooves or dips.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Driving in higher gears at lower engine revolutions significantly reduces engine noise, which is essential for reducing noise pollution in built-up areas.",

        "c": "Driving for a long time at high speed on a good, wide road."
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "This is known as speed adaptation. After driving at a high speed for a long time, the brain adjusts to the pace, causing the driver to feel they are going much slower than they actually are when they need to brake.",

      "question_number": 11,
      "question_text": "Why does driving on this specific stretch of road require greater alertness?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Because the road is wide enough for three vehicles to pass at once.",
        "b": "Because the road surface is uneven and road grip varies.",
        "c": "Because you must maintain a fixed speed of 100 km/h here."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Uneven tracks and varying surfaces require constant steering adjustments and careful speed control as the tyre grip changes unexpectedly.",
      "page_reference": 14,
      "image_url": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kobamelo-johnson/driver-quiz-images@f4af96a4bdb8324771da2c8fce1a6666e896f38b/CPT4-5_qz03-Q11.png"

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The rule of thumb for braking distance is calculating the square of your speed divided by 10. For 50 km/h, this is 5 x 5 = 25 metres.",
