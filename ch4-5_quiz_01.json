    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question_text": "You want to join the driving lane of the Highway from the accelerating lane but cannot join immediately due to high traffic density. Where must you stop, if necessary?",
      "options": {
        "a": "At the beginning of the accelerating lane to gain maximum speed later.",
        "b": "Toward the end of the accelerating lane.",
        "c": "On the hard shoulder to wait for the traffic to clear."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "According to the manual, if you cannot merge safely, you must continue to the end of the accelerating lane and stop there if necessary. You must not stop at the beginning as you need distance to match the speed of Highway traffic.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question_text": "What adversely affects road safety in this situation?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Water thrown up by vehicles in front.",
        "b": "The use of high-beam headlights by following traffic.",
        "c": "A sudden increase in the road's speed limit."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "On wet roads, 'wheel-spray' created by vehicles ahead severely impairs visibility. This is a primary risk that requires motorists to increase their following distance.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "question_text": "Why does driving on this stretch of road require greater alertness on the part of the motorist?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Because the road is designated as a high-speed clearway.",
        "b": "Because the road surface is uneven and road grip varies.",
        "c": "Because you must pull over every 5 kilometres to check tyre pressure."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The manual states that greater alertness is required when the road surface is uneven, as grip varies and the vehicle may become unstable if speed is not adjusted.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The manual is clear: Reversing and U-turns are strictly prohibited on Highways. The only safe and legal action is to proceed to the next available exit.",

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question_text": "On a road outside a built-up area with three lanes in each direction, which lane may you use for continuous travel if individual vehicles are travelling in the far-left lane?",

        "a": "The middle lane.",
        "b": "The far right-hand lane only.",

    {
      "question_number": 6,
      "question_text": "What is the primary risk you must reckon with in this residential area?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Junctions may be ignored and children may run into the road unexpectedly.",
        "b": "The road is likely to be a high-speed clearway for motor vehicles.",
        "c": "Oncoming traffic will be legally required to move to the hard shoulder."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Residential areas are high-risk zones where junctions are frequently overlooked and children often run into the roadway from between parked cars.",

    {
      "question_number": 7,
      "question_text": "Why must you maintain a particularly large safe distance from the vehicle in front when the road is wet?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Because your reaction time is naturally slower in the rain.",
        "b": "Because braking distances are greater than on a dry road.",
        "c": "Because it is required to allow the car behind to overtake you."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Braking distance increases on wet roads because there is less friction between the tyres and the roadway. A larger distance ensures you have enough room to stop safely.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 8,

    },
    {
      "question_number": 9,
      "question_text": "What must you reckon with when you see hazard warning lights flashing on a stationary vehicle?",
      "options": {
        "a": "A traffic jam, a broken-down vehicle, or a school bus with children alighting.",
        "b": "That the driver is signaling their intention to overtake you.",
        "c": "That the vehicle is about to accelerate rapidly."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Hazard lights draw attention to dangers such as accidents, breakdowns, the end of a traffic jam, or a school bus where children are boarding or alighting.",

        "b": "100 metres",
        "c": "130 metres"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The formula for braking distance is (Speed/10) x (Speed/10). For 100 km/h, the calculation is 10 x 10 = 100 metres.",

      "options": {
        "a": "An increase in your concentration and field of vision.",
        "b": "A tendency to lose your feel for speed and underestimate it.",
        "c": "The engine becoming more efficient and reducing fuel consumption."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Long-duration high-speed driving causes 'speed adaptation,' where the driver underestimates their actual speed, often leading to entering exits or bends too fast.",

    },
    {
      "question_number": 12,

        "c": "Use your horn and headlights to force the truck to move over."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "When approaching slower traffic on the Highway, the safest conduct is to remain in your lane, adjust your speed, and avoid dangerous overtaking maneuvers.",

        "c": "Brake hard while turning to keep the vehicle from swinging out."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Braking should be done in a straight line *before* the bend. Accelerating out of the bend only once the steering is straightened maintains vehicle stability.",

        "a": "By steering sharply from side to side to feel the tyre grip.",
        "b": "By carefully applying the brakes at very low speed.",
        "c": "By accelerating rapidly to see if the traction control light flashes."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The manual states that the safest way to test for slipperiness is to apply the brakes carefully at a very low speed when it is safe to do so.",
